StudentRoutineAnalysis
Project Overview
The Student Daily Routine Predictor is a machine learning project aimed at assisting students in managing their daily activities to optimize productivity, health, and well-being. Based on data collected through surveys from 100 students, the model takes into account various parameters such as study hours, sleep, exercise, social activities, and academic focus level. With this data, the model provides a personalized routine suggestion for the next day to help students better allocate time for essential tasks.

Key Components
Data Acquisition:

A survey was conducted to gather data on students' daily routines, focusing on key areas of their lives.
The data collected includes quantitative information on study hours, exercise, sleep, class hours, and time spent on social activities.
Time Management Algorithm:

A custom algorithm is designed to address common time management challenges faced by students.
The algorithm balances essential activities such as studying, rest, and exercise based on a student's current habits and needs.
User Interface (UI):

A user-friendly interface was created to collect data and allow students to input their daily routines conveniently.
The UI captures key metrics from each student, which are then processed and fed into the machine learning model for prediction.
Python-Based Implementation:

The entire system is built in Python, leveraging libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and mlxtend.
The project structure includes Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and routine generation.
Association Rule Mining:

Using association rule mining (Apriori algorithm), the model identifies patterns in student behavior and routine data.
These insights help uncover common patterns and correlations, which inform the model's routine suggestions and provide actionable insights on student habits.
Purpose and Benefits
This project aims to alleviate common time management challenges for students by providing daily routine recommendations that adapt to a studentâ€™s unique lifestyle and academic demands. By using data-driven insights and personalized suggestions, the project encourages students to adopt healthier and more productive routines.
